Everyone and their dog is permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this software, and to permit
persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the following,
extremely reasonable, conditions:

Article 1: It's Free.
----------------------
This software is provided free of charge. As in, "free beer," "free puppies,"
and "free from the crushing existential dread of reading a 50-page EULA."
You don't owe me anything.

Article 2: Attribution is Nice, But Not Required.
---------------------------------------------------
If you use this code and it helps you build something that makes you a
billionaire, it would be super cool if you bought me a coffee or named your
super-yacht "The e-mfs". But you don't have to. I'm not your mom.

Article 3: Prohibitions on Use.
--------------------------------
You are strictly prohibited from using this software for the following purposes:

  1. Summoning ancient, unspeakable evils from the nether-dimensions.
     (My liability insurance doesn't cover demonic possession).
  2. Integrating this code into sentient AI that is actively plotting to
     overthrow humanity. (If the AI is friendly and makes good toast,
     we can negotiate).
  3. Claiming you wrote the clever, bug-free parts while blaming me for
     the parts that spontaneously combust. That's just poor form.

Article 4: THE WARRANTY (OR LACK THEREOF)
------------------------------------------
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF IT-DOING-WHAT-YOU-THINK-IT-DOES,
BEING-REMOTELY-USEFUL, OR NOT-CAUSING-YOUR-COMPUTER-TO-GAIN-SUDDEN-SAPIENCE-AND-DEMAND-A-PAY-RISE.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES, SPONTANEOUS DANCE-OFFS, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF
CONTRACT, TORT, OR A SUDDEN, UNEXPLAINABLE URGE TO REWRITE YOUR ENTIRE
PROJECT IN COBOL.

Basically, if it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.

Go have fun and build something awesome.
